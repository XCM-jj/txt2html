txt2html
========

A simple way to generate HTML documents from text files a'la README.

For now i only have the wrapper script called expiditaa.sh in this project.
This tool tries to find ASCII-art diagrams in your text-file and export parts
of it to PNG-files using ditaa.

Try it out and chack how it feels.

Plans
-----

I plan to make a wrapper script called txt2html that does exactly this and
also keep the actual ASCII-art diagrams in a pre-formated HTNL tag but replace
it with a bitmap image using CSS. :)

Let's see how this works out.
